# Scene Setup

The easiest way to setup your scene is by right clicking, and going to GMBDK > Starters > Map Starters.
This will setup all the basic things you need to get started with making maps.

To rename your map, simply do what this GIF shows to do.

Optional, but recommended, you can also rename these to the same things you put above.

It will prompt you to reload the scene. It is safe to ignore, but if you choose to reload, make sure you save beforehand.

Now, one more step.

> NOTE: This will usually revert back to "ModName" if the project is closed then reopened. Simply do this again when you reopen it and you will be good.

You have now successfully renamed your map.
