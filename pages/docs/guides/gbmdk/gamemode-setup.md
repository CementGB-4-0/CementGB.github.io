# Gamemode Setup (for Maps)

> [!WARNING]
> The only currently supported gamemodes are Melee and Gang. All others are unsupported and - if you *do* get it to work - it is likely to break once official support *is* added. Experiment at your own risk!

Click on the "[YourMapName]-Info" asset you created via Map Starter, and set the Allowed Gamemodes flag in the Inspector window. 

Right away you'll notice that there are a lot of gamemodes that aren't seen in Gang Beasts. Those are unused/WIP gamemodes that are still in the game's code. They are unstable and do not work. Do not touch those.

> [!TODO]
> Write walkthrough on setting up maps for Waves.
