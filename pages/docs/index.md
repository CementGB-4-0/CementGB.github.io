# Cement Documentation
Welcome to the Cement docs. Here you will find detailed guides and references for the MelonLoader-based Gang Beasts modding library.  
> [!NOTE]
> **If you are a user of Cement, you do not need to do anything with it except install it.** To you, this mod alone should not change the gameplay at all.  
This documentation is aimed at novice to intermediate developers and content creators.
