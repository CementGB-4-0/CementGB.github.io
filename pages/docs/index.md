# Cement Documentation

Welcome to the Cement docs. Here you will find detailed guides and references for the MelonLoader-based Gang Beasts modding library CementGB, and information on mods made by the Cement Team.

You can download the library [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/gang-beasts/p/CementGB/CementGB/).

> [!NOTE]
> **If you are an end user of Cement, you do not need to do anything with it except install it.** To you, Cement alone should change the gameplay very little. It is simply a utility for developers to get their mods done faster and better.

## Installation

### Manual

1. Install the latest release of [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/) from the installer or the zipped file located on their GitHub Releases page. (If you already have it, make sure it's up to date)  
Further instructions can be found on [their wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).
2. Run the game after installing MelonLoader to make sure it generates all the necessary files.
3. Download `CementGB.dll` from our GitHub Releases page, linked on the [landing page](../) in the `Download` button, or on the [Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/gang-beasts/p/CementGB/CementGB/).
4. Drag `CementGB.dll` from your `Downloads` folder (or the 'Mods' folder inside the downloaded .zip, if downloading from Thunderstore) into the newly created `Mods` folder in your game folder, typically located at `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Gang Beasts` if you own the game on Steam and are installing on Windows.
5. All done! Run the game and check for any issues.

### Automated (Gale)

1. If you do not have Gale installed, go to the [Gale Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) and follow their installation instructions on their README/description.
2. Run Gale and select a game and profile at least once. This ensures Gale will be set up to handle automated download links on the Thunderstore website.
3. Go to the [CementGB Thunderstore page]() and click `Install with Mod Manager`.
4. Done! You must run the game through the mod manager for mods to apply.
