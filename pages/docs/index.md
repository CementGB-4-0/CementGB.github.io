# Cement Documentation

Welcome to the Cement docs. Here you will find detailed guides and references for the MelonLoader-based Gang Beasts modding library and information on Cement Team-official mods.  
You can download the library [here](../).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you are an end user of Cement, you do not need to do anything with it except install it.** To you, Cement alone should change the gameplay very little. It is simply a utility for developers to get their mods done faster and better.
