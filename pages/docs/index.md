# Cement Documentation

Welcome to the Cement docs. Here you will find detailed guides and references for the MelonLoader-based Gang Beasts modding library Cement 4.0 and information on mods made by the CementGB Team.  
You can download the library [here](../).

> [!NOTE]
> **If you are an end user of Cement, you do not need to do anything with it except install it.** To you, Cement alone should change the gameplay very little.

## Installation

1. Install the latest release of [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/) from the installer or the zipped file located on their GitHub Releases page. (If you already have it, make sure it's up to date)  
Further instructions can be found on [their wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).
2. Run the game after installing MelonLoader to make sure it generates all the necessary files.
3. Download `CementGB.dll` from our GitHub Releases page, linked on the [landing page](../) in the `Download` button.
4. Drag `CementGB.dll` from your `Downloads` folder into the newly created `Mods` folder in your game folder, typically located at `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Gang Beasts` if you own the game on Steam and are installing on Windows.
5. All done! Run the game and check for any issues.
